# üåü Time Series Forecasting with RNNs üåü

## üìù Description 
Time Series Forecasting is a challenging task that involves making predictions based on historical data points indexed in time order. In this project, the focus is on using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to forecast Bitcoin (BTC) prices. The goal is to predict the closing value of BTC after a given time window using the previous 24-hour data. The project leverages deep learning to solve a real-world financial problem.

This project demonstrates how to preprocess time series data, create a data pipeline in TensorFlow, and build effective RNN models for forecasting. It tackles the complexity of financial time series data, which often contains noise, and highlights the advantages of using RNNs for such tasks. The solution employs a robust machine learning approach to handle raw BTC data and deliver accurate forecasts.
