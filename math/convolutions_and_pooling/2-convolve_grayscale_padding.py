    Function that performs a convolution on grayscale images with

    Arguments:
        - images is a numpy.ndarray with shape (m, h, w) containing multiple
            grayscale images
            * m is the number of images
            * h is the height in pixels of the images
            * w is the width in pixels of the images
        - kernel is a numpy.ndarray with shape (kh, kw) containing the kernel
            for the convolution
            * kh is the height of the kernel
            * kw is the width of the kernel
        - padding is a tuple of (ph, pw)
