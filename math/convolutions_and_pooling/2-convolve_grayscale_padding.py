    Function that performs a convolution on grayscale images with

        - images is a numpy.ndarray with shape (m, h, w) containing multiple
            grayscale images
            * m is the number of images
            * h is the height in pixels of the images

        - kernel is a numpy.ndarray with shape (kh, kw) containing the kernel
            for the convolution
            * kh is the height of the kernel
            * kw is the width of the kernel
